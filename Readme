Today we all know how our world is advancing in the Finance Sector with the help of online transaction technology.
No doubt this technology has enabled alot of transaction to be done without any hectic process. Just by adding revelant details money can be transferred to the beneficary.
But good things always comes with some cons i.e., as alot of transactions are processed everyday , it is identified that many Fraud transactions are also happening everyday
keeping this problem in mind , I have worked on a Financial Transaction Dataset which has a 95% of accuracy in identifying the nature of transactions(FRAUD, NON-FRAUD).

In this repo. one can find how I applied the logics of Machine Learning Algorithm with the help of PYTHON Programming Language to develop a model which can perform this
task with ease at any scale big to small dataset.
